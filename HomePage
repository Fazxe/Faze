<p>The Pacific is the biggest ocean on earth and covers more than 30% of the Earth surface. 
The Pacific means 'peaceful' which come from the Latin word 'pace' for peace. 
The Challenger Deep in the Marina Trench, which is located to the West of the Philippines and north of New Guinea, 
is the deepest point in the Pacific Ocean with 35,827ft. 
It is the lowest part of the earth crust and was formed by the collision of two tectonic plates.
The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the largest reef in the world stretching over more than 2,300km and including more than 1,000 islands.
It was proclaimed in 1981 a World Heritage Site and is now a protected area. Corals, tiny marine animals, also form many atolls in the Pacific Oceans.
Most of the supply of fish in the world is caught in the Pacific.
